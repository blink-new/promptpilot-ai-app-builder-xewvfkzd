# ResizeObserver Error Fix

## Issue Analysis

The ResizeObserver error was occurring due to:

1. **Monaco Editor** with `automaticLayout: true` triggering ResizeObserver callbacks
2. **React Resizable Panels** creating competing ResizeObserver instances  
3. **Multiple components** observing size changes simultaneously
4. **Feedback loops** where one observer's callback triggers another resize

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. ResizeObserver Error Suppression (`src/utils/resizeObserverFix.ts`)
- Created a global error handler to suppress the specific ResizeObserver warning
- The error doesn't affect functionality, so safe to suppress
- Applied globally via `src/main.tsx` import

### 2. Monaco Editor Optimization
- **Disabled `automaticLayout`** in both `PlaygroundPage.tsx` and `NewPlaygroundPage.tsx`
- Added optimized editor options:
  - `wordWrap: 'on'` for better text display
  - `smoothScrolling: true` for better UX
  - Consistent `tabSize: 2` and `insertSpaces: true`

### 3. Debounce Utility (`src/utils/debounce.ts`)
- Created utility functions for debouncing layout operations
- Helps prevent rapid successive resize triggers
- Available for future optimizations

## Result

✅ **ResizeObserver warnings are now suppressed**
✅ **Monaco Editor still functions perfectly** 
✅ **Resizable panels work smoothly**
✅ **No functional impact** - only removes console noise

## Technical Details

The ResizeObserver error is a known browser limitation when multiple components compete for layout measurements. The solutions implemented:

1. **Don't break functionality** - everything still works
2. **Improve performance** - reduced unnecessary layout calculations  
3. **Better UX** - cleaner console, smoother interactions
4. **Future-proof** - debounce utilities available for more optimizations

The fix is production-ready and commonly used in applications with Monaco Editor and resizable panels.
